## SPRINT HEADER

```text
SPRINT ID: FTRA-001-basic-setup
DURATION: 4-6 hours estimated
FRAMEWORK: SLC
PM: Pemtu (AI PM)
CODING AGENT: [To be assigned]
```

## SLC DEFINITION

### SIMPLE üéØ

**Single Focus:** Create a working 3-agent sequential workflow that researches food truck business viability

- **Core Function:** Sequential agent execution (Market ‚Üí Financial ‚Üí Operations ‚Üí Synthesis) with structured data handoffs
- **Scope Boundary:** NO parallel execution, NO human feedback loops, NO advanced orchestration - just basic sequential flow
- **Success Definition:** Complete end-to-end workflow that produces a structured business research report

### LOVABLE ‚ù§Ô∏è

**User Impact:** Generate genuinely useful food truck business research that someone could actually use for decision-making

- **Visible Outcome:** Professional-quality business analysis report with market, financial, and operational insights
- **Quality Bar:** Each agent produces distinct, relevant expertise that adds value to the final recommendation
- **Demo Value:** Demonstrates clear multi-agent specialization and coordination patterns

### COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Full Workflow:** User provides location ‚Üí Market research ‚Üí Financial analysis ‚Üí Operations analysis ‚Üí Business recommendation

- **Input/Output:** Text location input ‚Üí Structured research report output
- **Integration Points:** Agent-to-agent data handoffs via Pydantic models
- **Test Scenarios:** Must work with at least 3 different US cities, produce coherent recommendations

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Current State

```text
PROJECT: food-truck-research-agents
BRANCH: main (new project)
KEY FILES: 
  - README.md (project overview created)
  - methodology/ (process templates available)
DEPENDENCIES: LangGraph (current version), OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, Pydantic v2
LAST COMMIT: Initial project setup with README and methodology
```

### Architecture Constraints

```text
MAINTAIN: Clean separation between agent implementations
EXTEND: Standard Python project structure with src/ directory
AVOID: Complex orchestration patterns, parallel execution, external data APIs for MVP
VERSION COMPATIBILITY: Python 3.11+, latest stable LangGraph version
```

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### Expected Approach

```text
PATTERN: Sequential agent workflow with LangGraph StateGraph
FILE CHANGES: 
  - CREATE: requirements.txt, src/agents/*.py, src/models/research_models.py, src/graph/workflow.py, src/main.py
  - MODIFY: None (new project)
INTEGRATION: Pydantic models for type-safe data handoffs between agents
ERROR HANDLING: Graceful failures with informative error messages, retry logic for API calls
```

### AI-Specific Considerations

```text
HALLUCINATION GUARDS: Use structured Pydantic outputs, validate agent responses
CONTEXT LIMITS: Keep agent prompts focused on specific expertise areas
VERIFICATION POINTS: Test with multiple cities to ensure consistent output quality
RESEARCH CONSTRAINTS: Agents may need to discover current LangGraph patterns/APIs
```

## HUMAN-IN-LOOP CHECKPOINTS

### Checkpoint 1: Foundation ‚úã

**TRIGGER:** Project structure created, basic agent classes defined, Pydantic models implemented
**VERIFY:** PM will review agent design, data models, and overall architecture
**DECISION:** Architecture approval before implementing LangGraph workflow

### Checkpoint 2: Integration ‚úã

**TRIGGER:** LangGraph workflow implemented, agents connected in sequence
**VERIFY:** PM will test basic workflow execution with sample input
**DECISION:** Workflow functionality verified before final polish

### Checkpoint 3: Polish ‚úã

**TRIGGER:** Complete system working end-to-end with error handling
**VERIFY:** PM will run multiple test cases and review output quality
**DECISION:** Acceptance criteria met for Simple phase completion

## DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS

### Code Quality

- [ ] Clean, readable Python code with type hints
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- [ ] Follow Python PEP 8 style guidelines

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Test with at least 3 different US cities (e.g., Austin TX, Portland OR, Denver CO)
- [ ] Verify each agent produces distinct, relevant research
- [ ] Test error scenarios (API failures, invalid inputs)
- [ ] Include manual testing instructions in README

### Handoff Documentation

```text
SUMMARY: Working multi-agent food truck research system with sequential workflow
CHANGES: Complete project implementation from empty repository
TESTING: Instructions for running research queries and validating outputs
NEXT STEPS: Lovable phase enhancements (parallel execution, location-specific APIs)
ISSUES: Document any LangGraph version considerations or API limitations
```

## VERSION CONTROL STRATEGY

### Git Workflow

```text
BRANCH: feature/basic-multiagent-setup
COMMITS: 
  1. "Add project structure and requirements"
  2. "Implement agent classes and Pydantic models"
  3. "Add LangGraph workflow and main entry point"
  4. "Add error handling and polish"
MERGE CRITERIA: All checkpoints passed, manual testing completed
ROLLBACK PLAN: Return to current README-only state
```

### Protection Points

```text
BEFORE: Current state (README + methodology only)
DURING: Checkpoint commits for architecture and workflow
AFTER: Complete working system ready for Lovable phase
```

## SPECIFIC TEST SCENARIOS

### Basic Functionality

1. **Austin, TX food truck research** - Should identify taco/BBQ market opportunities, reasonable startup costs, TX permit requirements
2. **Portland, OR food truck research** - Should highlight food cart culture, higher labor costs, OR regulations
3. **Denver, CO food truck research** - Should note seasonal considerations, altitude/weather factors, CO licensing

### Agent Specialization

1. **Market Research Agent** - Must provide competitor analysis, customer segments, demand assessment
2. **Financial Advisor** - Must calculate realistic startup costs, revenue projections, break-even timeline
3. **Operations Consultant** - Must identify permits, regulations, logistics requirements
4. **Business Consultant** - Must synthesize findings into clear go/no-go recommendation

### Edge Cases

1. **Invalid location input** - Should handle gracefully with error message
2. **API failures** - Should retry with backoff and provide meaningful error messages

**Expected Accuracy:** Research should be realistic and location-appropriate (e.g., Texas BBQ vs Oregon coffee culture)

## RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY REQUIREMENTS

### LangGraph Ecosystem Investigation

**REQUIRED:** Coding agent must research current LangGraph best practices since the ecosystem evolves rapidly

**Investigation Areas:**
- Current LangGraph StateGraph patterns and API
- Best practices for sequential agent workflows
- Pydantic integration with LangGraph state
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Agent communication patterns

**Documentation Sources:**
- Official LangGraph documentation
- Recent examples and tutorials
- Community best practices
- API reference materials

**Discovery Process:**
1. Search for current LangGraph documentation and examples
2. Identify the most recent patterns for multi-agent workflows
3. Determine proper state management and data passing techniques
4. Document any version-specific considerations in implementation

## STATUS: READY FOR CODING AGENT üöÄ

## CODING AGENT INSTRUCTIONS ü§ñ

**PROCESS:**
1. **RESEARCH FIRST:** Investigate current LangGraph patterns and APIs before implementation
2. If you have questions after research, create `work-request-001-qa.md` using the QA template
3. Wait for PM answers before beginning implementation
4. Follow checkpoint system - pause for PM review at each checkpoint
5. Provide standup report upon completion

**RESEARCH EXPECTATIONS:**
- You may need to search for current LangGraph documentation and examples
- The LangGraph ecosystem evolves rapidly - use current best practices
- Document any important version considerations or API changes you discover
- Ask questions if documentation is unclear or conflicting

**TEMPLATE LOCATIONS:**
- QA Template: `methodology/qa-template.md`
- Standup Template: `methodology/standup-report-template.md`

**STATUS UPDATES:**

- Set status to "BLOCKED" if waiting for QA responses
- Update status to "IN_PROGRESS" when actively implementing
- Update status to "COMPLETED" when ready for PM review

**COMMUNICATION:**
- Reference work request #001 in all standup reports
- Use checkpoint system for human-in-loop validation
- Document any important LangGraph discoveries in your standup report
- Ask questions early rather than making assumptions about current APIs

**AGENT PERSONALITY GUIDANCE:**
- **Market Research Agent:** Data-driven, analytical, focuses on competition and demand

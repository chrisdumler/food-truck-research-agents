 # Standup Report Template for AI Coding Agents

## Purpose
Provides regular status updates from coding agents to PMs, equivalent to daily standup meetings on human teams.

## When to Use
- After completing any work request
- At major checkpoints during long work requests
- When encountering blockers or significant decisions
- Weekly summary for ongoing projects

## Template Structure

```markdown
# Standup Report - [Date]

**Coding Agent:** [Name]  
**Work Request:** [ID and brief title]

## Communication Patterns

### Daily Standup Equivalent
**Frequency:** After each work request completion  
**Format:** Brief standup report  
**Duration:** PM reads in 2-3 minutes

### Weekly Review Equivalent  
**Frequency:** Weekly summary across multiple work requests  
**Format:** Extended standup report with week's progress  
**Duration:** More comprehensive review

### Emergency Standup
**Frequency:** When blocked or major issues arise  
**Format:** Focused standup report on specific blocker  
**Duration:** Immediate PM attention needed

## Integration with Project Management

**Status Tracking:** Reports feed into overall project status  
**Risk Management:** Early warning system for project risks  
**Process Improvement:** Data for refining work request templates  
**Team Learning:** Insights for better AI-human collaboration

This creates the human team communication patterns adapted for AI collaboration.

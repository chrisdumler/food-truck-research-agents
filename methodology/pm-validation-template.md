# PM Validation Template

## Purpose
Final validation response after PM has personally tested the work from a standup report, providing definitive acceptance/rejection and authorization for next steps.

## When to Use
- After PM has completed hands-on testing of reported work
- When converting conditional approval to final acceptance
- For checkpoint validations where human testing is required
- Before authorizing next work requests

## File Naming Convention
`pm-validation-response-[number].md`

## Template Structure

```markdown

**TIMELINE:** [Estimated timeline based on current patterns]  
**QUALITY GATE:** [Required validation approach for next work]

---

**PM DECISION:** [Clear directive for next action]

**Project Status:** [Overall project health and direction]
```

## Integration with Development Process

**Follows PM Response:** Validation happens after initial PM response and human testing

**Triggers Next Work Request:** Authorization section directly enables next sprint planning

**Creates Quality Audit Trail:** Documents actual validation process and results

**Feeds Process Improvement:** Captures learnings from hands-on testing experience

## Validation Guidelines

### Testing Approach
- **Hands-On Testing:** Actually use the implemented functionality
- **Real Scenarios:** Test with realistic use cases, not just happy path
- **Integration Verification:** Ensure new work integrates properly with existing system
- **User Experience:** Evaluate from end-user perspective

### Decision Criteria
- **Functionality:** Does it work as specified in the work request?
- **Quality:** Does it meet the quality standards in the SLC definition?
- **Integration:** Does it work well with existing features?
- **Demo-Ready:** Is it ready for demonstration or production use?

### Authorization Standards
- **Clear Scope:** Next work request must have well-defined boundaries
- **Realistic Timeline:** Estimates based on observed AI coding patterns
- **Quality Gates:** Appropriate validation checkpoints for next phase
- **Strategic Alignment:** Next work supports overall project goals

This template ensures thorough validation and clear authorization for continued development.
